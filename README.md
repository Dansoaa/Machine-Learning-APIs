# Machine-Learning-APIs
An API that might be requested to interact with a ML model.

# A Docker container hosts the FastAPI Sepsis Prediction Application, seamlessly integrated with a machine learning model.

## Objective Of This Project
The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model for sepsis classification and deploy it as a web application using FastAPI, thereby enabling real-time predictions.

## Setup
To set up the environment and run the application, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites:
Python 3 installed on your system (Python version 3.11).

## Setup Steps:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the root directory of the repository.

For Windows:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Application:
Once the environment is set up, run the main app from the repository root.
